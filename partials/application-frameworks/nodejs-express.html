          <span class='bold'>Usage:</span>
          I learned NodeJS as an undergraduate and used it to host a variety of small HTML based projects. As a graduate student, I learned Express as after some research it seemed to be the best choice for a small, simple framework for the project I was completing.

          <span class='bold'>Self-Rating Explanation and Musings:</span>
          I gave myself only 2 stars with NodeJS/Express because although I was always able to get the functionality I wanted from them both, I never wanted any behavior too complex. As a result, I never really took a deep dive into their features/design as I have with other frameworks.
