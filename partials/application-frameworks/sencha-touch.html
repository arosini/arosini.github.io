          As part of my final project in graduate school, I created a mobile application using Sencha Touch 2 for a real world client. The application, which integrated heavily with the Google Maps and Calendar APIs, took advantage of Sencha Touch's easy integration with
          <a target="_blank" href="http://phonegap.com/">Phonegap</a>
          and was able to compile into both an Android and iOS application. After I graduated, I provided a small amount of extra support for the client's developers in order to understand more about the applications development environmentt, as well as add a few more features to the application

          I gave myself 3 stars with Sencha Touch after such a short time of working with it because the framework isn't as large as something like Spring or Rails. Sencha Touch definitly had a very high learning curve at the start for me, mostly because it has much smaller community support than I was used to and finding example code was not easy. However once I learned a few of the basic tricks Sencha Touch uses and undertood the general design of the framework, I realized most of its implementation was very consistent. I was eventually able to predict componenent and method names, making implementation a breeze. I think Sencha Touch has good ideas/framework design, however needs more maturity in terms of documentation, community support and the framework's components.
