          <span class='bold'>Self-Rating Explanation and Musings:</span>
          I gave myself 2 and half stars with Spring after only 6 months of use because I have been working with it heavily almost every day for those 6 months. While I have only focused on using a few of the Spring modules (mainly Spring MVC), I feel confident that I can solve most of the problems I face after a little bit of thought and research (and maybe adding a depedency or two). Spring is an extremely large framework with classes, modules and extensions for everything under the sun -- as a result I think my self-rating of my abilities with Spring will improve as I use and learn about more of these components. As a side note, my current self-rating might be slightly inflated because of how easy it is to do some things in Spring (like dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming) and my many, many years of Java programming while in academia.
