          I gave myself 4 stars for Ruby on Rails because I have been working with it for a long time (relatively) and have used many of the features the framework provides. I did full-stack application development at AthleteTrax, writing routes/controller actions, coding HTML/CSS/JavaScript and then writing tests for Cucumber. I also learned a lot about configuration and environment management using Rails during my time at UPMC Enterprises. Through learning Rails, I have become competent with many of the supporting technologies that the Rails stack typically involves: HAML, SASS, Cucumber, Rspec, MiniTest, Capybara, JQuery, Bootstrap, SQL and of course, Ruby. I ended up writing this website with HAML, SASS, Bootstrap and JQuery because of how familiar I have become with them. However, I am reluctant to give myself over 4 stars because I am always learning new things about Rails, either from Railscasts, StackOverflow or my co-workers.
