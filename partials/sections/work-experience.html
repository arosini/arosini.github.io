                During my time at UPMC Enterprises, I have learned a lot about agile/scrum as well as working with a larger team. I have worked on two major projects so far.

                The first project I worked on was an already mature Rails API which processed unstructured medical documents. There were also several supporting projects such as an example front-end implementation for the API, a service for resolving patient identities and a Puppet project for configuration management. I worked on this for about 4 months doing primarily bug fixes, but occasionly introducing some new functionality. The project used supporting technologies such as RabbitMQ, Statsd/Graphite, Logback, Puppet, MonogDB, SQL, JMeter, Rspec, Cucumber and Git.

              <div class='panel-body-section'>
                The project I am currently working on is a brand new API using Spring which serves data in the
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/">FHIR</a>
                format. I developed many of the APIs endpoints, each of which involved setting up the URL, handling parameters, building the query and then mapping the data from the existing format into FHIR. I also set up a client validation service, which requests data from the API in either XML or JSON and then validates that the response conforms to the XML schemas provided by the FHIR standard. The project uses supporting technologies such as Spring Boot, Spring Security (OAuth), Spring AOP, Maven, Gradle, Jenkins, Docker, Statsd, slf4j/log4j, various static code analysis tools, Git, JUnit, and Cucumber.

                At AthleteTrax, a small Pittsburgh based startup, I helped developed all aspects of the company's Ruby on Rails application. Check out the

                my supervisor wrote about me. Contrary to other work environments I have been a part of, the development team at AthleteTrax was very small, consisting of only me, my supervisor and 2 remote developers in Europe.
