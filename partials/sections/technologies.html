                  <a href="#sencha-touch">Sencha Touch</a>
                  and most recently learned CoffeScript to write this site. I am also always looking for new Angular2 tutorials, and am excited to try to create something once a stable version is released. I am still trying to master object oriented programming with JavaScript, as well as the the model-view-whatever setup many JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and Backbone provide.
