                I gave myself 4 stars for Ruby on Rails because I have been working with it for a long time (relatively) and have used many of the features the framework provides. I did full-stack application development at AthleteTrax, writing routes/controller actions, coding HTML/CSS/JavaScript and then writing tests for Cucumber. I also learned a lot about configuration and environment management using Rails during my time at UPMC Enterprises. Through learning Rails, I have become competent with many of the supporting technologies that the Rails stack typically involves: HAML, SASS, Cucumber, Rspec, MiniTest, Capybara, JQuery, Bootstrap, SQL and of course, Ruby. I ended up writing this website with HAML, SASS, Bootstrap and JQuery because of how familiar I have become with them. However, I am reluctant to give myself over 4 stars because I am always learning new things about Rails, either from Railscasts, StackOverflow or my co-workers.

                I gave myself 2 and half stars with Spring after only 6 months of use because I have been working with it heavily almost every day for those 6 months. While I have only focused on using a few of the Spring modules (mainly Spring MVC), I feel confident that I can solve most of the problems I face after a little bit of thought and research (and maybe adding a depedency or two). Spring is an extremely large framework with classes, modules and extensions for everything under the sun -- as a result I think my self-rating of my abilities with Spring will improve as I use and learn about more of these components. As a side note, my current self-rating might be slightly inflated because of how easy it is to do some things in Spring (like dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming) and my many, many years of Java programming while in academia.

                As part of my final project in graduate school, I created a mobile application using Sencha Touch 2 for a real world client. The application, which integrated heavily with the Google Maps and Calendar APIs, took advantage of Sencha Touch's easy integration with
                <a target="_blank" href="http://phonegap.com/">Phonegap</a>
                and was able to compile into both an Android and iOS application. After I graduated, I provided a small amount of extra support for the client's developers in order to understand more about the applications development environmentt, as well as add a few more features to the application

                I gave myself 3 stars with Sencha Touch after such a short time of working with it because the framework isn't as large as something like Spring or Rails. Sencha Touch definitly had a very high learning curve at the start for me, mostly because it has much smaller community support than I was used to and finding example code was not easy. However once I learned a few of the basic tricks Sencha Touch uses and undertood the general design of the framework, I realized most of its implementation was very consistent. I was eventually able to predict componenent and method names, making implementation a breeze. I think Sencha Touch has good ideas/framework design, however needs more maturity in terms of documentation, community support and the framework's components.

                I learned NodeJS as an undergraduate and used it to host a variety of small HTML based projects. As a graduate student, I learned Express as after some research it seemed to be the best choice for a small, simple framework for the project I was completing.

                I gave myself only 2 stars with NodeJS/Express because although I was always able to get the functionality I wanted from them both, I never wanted any behavior too complex. As a result, I never really took a deep dive into their features/design as I have with other frameworks.

                I learned Android for one of my courses in graduate school. We breifly learned the basics of the framework, and then had 2 weeks to write an application.

                <span class='bold'>Self-Rating Explanation and Musings:</span>
                I only gave myself 1 and a half stars because I worked with Android for such a short amount of time and only wrote 1 application, though I did learn a lot about the whole development process - from design, to implementation to publishing. I did think it was pretty cool writing native apps, but at the time I was interested in learning other things and expanding my technology toolset more than I was in continuing to learn Android. Also the Android emulator is without a doubt one of the most frustratingly slow pieces of software I have ever had to deal with, so that did deter me from continuing on.
