- Update resume
- Check mobile

Bugs:
- Click link and it stays underlined
- Spam header link and cannot scroll

For Review:
- Check new Contact wording
- Check new this website wording
- Check design of each section

Old Notes:
- Change sentence structure for "this website" - no "i did this, then this" - talk about the website itself, not why you used what you used. ex: this website features a layout that is meant to lead the reader through a more comprehensive, aesthetically pleasing, and interactive experience than an average resume.  This project really made me view ///coding words/// with a new perspective focused on design. (you are now more well rounded in your skills because you researched modern website design)

- Add descriptions of skill categories?
