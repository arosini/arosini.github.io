      I learned Android for one of my courses in graduate school. We breifly learned the basics of the framework, and then had 2 weeks to write an application.

      %span.bold Self-Rating Explanation and Musings:
      I only gave myself 1 and a half stars because I worked with Android for such a short amount of time and only wrote 1 application, though I did learn a lot about the whole development process - from design, to implementation to publishing. I did think it was pretty cool writing native apps, but at the time I was interested in learning other things and expanding my technology toolset more than I was in continuing to learn Android. Also the Android emulator is without a doubt one of the most frustratingly slow pieces of software I have ever had to deal with, so that did deter me from continuing on.
