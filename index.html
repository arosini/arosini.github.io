                  Welcome to my online resume! I am a software developer who loves to write web applications, APIs and code that reduces programming effort! I am currently looking to continue in my role as a software developer, however one day I hope to lead a team of application developers who architect scalable, reusable solutions which help other development teams.

                    This is a link to my Rails 'starter-app'. I made it as a jump-off point to quickly start new Rails projects. It contains my preferred Rails development stack, functionality many apps would require, bits of code I find myself using in various projects, UI design patterns that I prefer, a heavily opinionated use of the Rails framework and my personal favorite, a generic set of Cucumber steps. I am actively developing it in my spare time. None of the projects I have used this for have made it to fruition yet however...

                    This Node/Express project pulls data from an SQL database, crunches it into some meaningful statistics, and then displays those statistics in tables and graphs. The SQL database is owned by a team of PhD students who are trying to build a program which uses NLP to help students learn their course materials. Students would go through the course materials (slides, video or audio usually) within the program, and answer questions every so often about what they just learned. When a student gets a question wrong, the program points them to some course material they could review before they attempt the question again. The goal of the project is to automate the process of providing reference materials after an incorrect response. The goal of my application was to visuialize the data they collected, as well as to see if the provided reference materials actually helps the students.

                    This is the Android app I wrote in graduate school. It wasn't a requirement to publish the app but I did anyway because I had some extra time. The app is for players of the game DotA (Defense of the Ancients) 2. It compiles the stats from their most recent games by sending requests to a web service we had to write as part of the same assignment. The web service was required to communicate with an existing API. I chose to work with the Steam (the owner of DotA 2) and DotA 2 APIs because DotA is without a doubt my favorite game ever. The application has 17 current installs and has had a total of 120 installs (only 1 of which is me, I promise).

                    I wrote this website using Middleman, HAML, SASS, and CoffeeScript. I chose Middleman because it contains all the front-end goodies that come with Rails, however was designed for static websites (such as this!) and doesn't have all the unecessary backend components. I like HAML/SASS/CoffeeScript over HTML/CSS/JS because I like being forced to write well indented code and don't see a need for tags. Also CoffeeScript stops me from shooting myself in the foot with the 'intricies' of JavaScript. I also used JQuery 1.9 and Bootstrap 3 because I find them very easy to use and full of great features.

                          During my time at UPMC Enterprises, I have learned a lot about agile/scrum as well as working with a larger team. I have worked on two major projects so far.

                          The first project I worked on was an already mature Rails API which processed unstructured medical documents. There were also several supporting projects such as an example front-end implementation for the API, a service for resolving patient identities and a Puppet project for configuration management. I worked on this for about 4 months doing primarily bug fixes, but occasionly introducing some new functionality. The project used supporting technologies such as RabbitMQ, Statsd/Graphite, Logback, Puppet, MonogDB, SQL, JMeter, Rspec, Cucumber and Git.

                          The project I am currently working on is a brand new API using Spring which serves data in the
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/">FHIR</a>
                          format. I developed many of the APIs endpoints, each of which involved setting up the URL, handling parameters, building the query and then mapping the data from the existing format into FHIR. I also set up a client validation service, which requests data from the API in either XML or JSON and then validates that the response conforms to the XML schemas provided by the FHIR standard. The project uses supporting technologies such as Spring Boot, Spring Security (OAuth), Spring AOP, Maven, Gradle, Jenkins, Docker, Statsd, slf4j/log4j, various static code analysis tools, Git, JUnit, and Cucumber.

                            and most recently learned CoffeScript to write this site. I am also always looking for new Angular2 tutorials, and am excited to try to create something once a stable version is released. I am still trying to master object oriented programming with JavaScript, as well as the the model-view-whatever setup many JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and Backbone provide.

                          I gave myself 4 stars for Ruby on Rails because I have been working with it for a long time (relatively) and have used many of the features the framework provides. I did full-stack application development at AthleteTrax, writing routes/controller actions, coding HTML/CSS/JavaScript and then writing tests for Cucumber. I also learned a lot about configuration and environment management using Rails during my time at UPMC Enterprises. Through learning Rails, I have become competent with many of the supporting technologies that the Rails stack typically involves: HAML, SASS, Cucumber, Rspec, MiniTest, Capybara, JQuery, Bootstrap, SQL and of course, Ruby. I ended up writing this website with HAML, SASS, Bootstrap and JQuery because of how familiar I have become with them. However, I am reluctant to give myself over 4 stars because I am always learning new things about Rails, either from Railscasts, StackOverflow or my co-workers.

                          I gave myself 2 and half stars with Spring after only 6 months of use because I have been working with it heavily almost every day for those 6 months. While I have only focused on using a few of the Spring modules (mainly Spring MVC), I feel confident that I can solve most of the problems I face after a little bit of thought and research (and maybe adding a depedency or two). Spring is an extremely large framework with classes, modules and extensions for everything under the sun -- as a result I think my self-rating of my abilities with Spring will improve as I use and learn about more of these components. As a side note, my current self-rating might be slightly inflated because of how easy it is to do some things in Spring (like dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming) and my many, many years of Java programming while in academia.

                          As part of my final project in graduate school, I created a mobile application using Sencha Touch 2 for a real world client. The application, which integrated heavily with the Google Maps and Calendar APIs, took advantage of Sencha Touch's easy integration with
                          <a target="_blank" href="http://phonegap.com/">Phonegap</a>
                          and was able to compile into both an Android and iOS application. After I graduated, I provided a small amount of extra support for the client's developers in order to understand more about the applications development environmentt, as well as add a few more features to the application

                          I gave myself 3 stars with Sencha Touch after such a short time of working with it because the framework isn't as large as something like Spring or Rails. Sencha Touch definitly had a very high learning curve at the start for me, mostly because it has much smaller community support than I was used to and finding example code was not easy. However once I learned a few of the basic tricks Sencha Touch uses and undertood the general design of the framework, I realized most of its implementation was very consistent. I was eventually able to predict componenent and method names, making implementation a breeze. I think Sencha Touch has good ideas/framework design, however needs more maturity in terms of documentation, community support and the framework's components.

                          I learned NodeJS as an undergraduate and used it to host a variety of small HTML based projects. As a graduate student, I learned Express as after some research it seemed to be the best choice for a small, simple framework for the project I was completing.

                          I gave myself only 2 stars with NodeJS/Express because although I was always able to get the functionality I wanted from them both, I never wanted any behavior too complex. As a result, I never really took a deep dive into their features/design as I have with other frameworks.

                          I only gave myself 1 and a half stars because I worked with Android for such a short amount of time and only wrote 1 application, though I did learn a lot about the whole development process - from design, to implementation to publishing. I did think it was pretty cool writing native apps, but at the time I was interested in learning other things and expanding my technology toolset more than I was in continuing to learn Android. Also the Android emulator is without a doubt one of the most frustratingly slow pieces of software I have ever had to deal with, so that did deter me from continuing on.
